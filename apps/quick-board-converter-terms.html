            <h2>Effective Date: [Insert Date]</h2>
            <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the Quick Board Converter application ("App") provided
                via the monday.com App Marketplace. By installing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these
                Terms.</p>

            <h3>1. Use of the App</h3>
            <p>The App is designed to help users of monday.com convert existing boards into templates efficiently. You
                are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App solely in conjunction with your
                monday.com account.</p>

            <h3>2. Data and Privacy</h3>
            <p>The App accesses only the minimum data necessary for functionality (e.g., board structures, item
                metadata). All data is handled according to monday.com security requirements. No data are stored or
                shared outside of the monday.com environment.</p>

            <h3>3. Restrictions</h3>
            <p>You may not reverse-engineer, sublicense, or misuse the App. The App must be used in compliance with
                applicable laws and monday.com’s terms.</p>

            <h3>4. Liability</h3>
            <p>The App is provided "as is" without warranties. We are not liable for data loss, outages, or indirect
                damages arising from its use.</p>

            <h3>5. Changes</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right to update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App after changes implies
                your acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

            <h3>6. Contact</h3>
